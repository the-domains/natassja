Singer/songwriter Natassja is a soul music artist whose contribution to the genre challenges the notion of what contemporary soul music should be. Her urban-influenced and sometimes moody, folk-tinged arias involve more than a moderate degree of genre bending. At times, she even blurs the genre.

Natassja is as comfortable listening to the gritty elements of southern "Trap" music, as she is listening to Raheem DeVaughn soul, Somi's inspired_Lagos Music Salon_Jazz odyssey, or EDM's Chase & Status. From the folk of Dylan, Clannad, and Baez to the contemporary styling of Sade and Seal, Natassja steeps herself in music that moves her spirit.
