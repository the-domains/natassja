Come on out to join me and my band as we introduce the music slated for my first full-length studio album. You will be my ears for the evening as we jam the new material and let you be our "tastemakers" for the evening. I know that's a lot to throw at you but I figure we've been friends for so long and you've supported me and the music all along so who better to share in this experience and give me your feedback. I value that more than you'll ever know.
